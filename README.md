```

- **STX**: Primary lending asset
- **Collateral Tokens**: Secure loan backing
- **Automated Fees**: 1% platform fee on loans

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Lenders

1. **Create Lending Offer**: Set your terms and availability
   ```clarity
   (create-lending-offer max-amount interest-rate max-duration min-collateral-ratio)
   ```

2. **Wait for Borrowers**: Your offer becomes available to borrowers
3. **Earn Interest**: Collect repayments with interest automatically

### For Borrowers

1. **Find Lending Offers**: Browse available loan opportunities
   ```clarity
   (get-lending-offer offer-id)
   ```

2. **Request Loan**: Submit loan request with collateral
   ```clarity
   (request-loan offer-id loan-amount duration-blocks collateral-amount)
   ```

3. **Repay On Time**: Pay back principal + interest to retrieve collateral
   ```clarity
   (repay-loan loan-id)
   ```

## üìà Example Scenarios

### Standard Lending Flow
```
1. Lender creates offer: 100 STX, 10% APR, 30 days, 120% collateral
2. Borrower requests: 50 STX for 15 days with 60 collateral tokens
3. Loan executes: Borrower gets 50 STX, collateral locked
4. Repayment: ~51.03 STX (principal + interest + 1% platform fee)
5. Success: Borrower gets collateral back, lender earns interest
```

### Liquidation Scenario
```
1. Borrower takes 50 STX loan with 60 collateral tokens
2. Loan expires without repayment
3. Anyone can call liquidate-loan()
4. Lender receives the 60 collateral tokens as compensation
```
